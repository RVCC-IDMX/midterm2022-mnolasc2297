                <p> Since beginning my journey as a freelance designer over 5 years ago, I've done remote work for agencies, 
                    consulted for startups, and collaborated with talented people to create digital products for both business
                     and consumer use. I'm quietly confident, naturally curious, and perpetually working on improving my chops 
                     one design problem at a time. My goal is to provide my clients with the simplest, yet modern site you can imagine.
                    You want your user to be able to navigate with ease and find your site visually appealing at the same time. </p>
